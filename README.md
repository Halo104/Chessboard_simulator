**Chessboard Simulator and Manager**

This is the third C++ coursework as part of the MSc Computing course from Imperial College London.

The task is to write a program that simulates and manages a chess game, accepting moves in the format (source square, destination square), where a square is referred to using a letter in the range A-H and a number in the range 1-8. It should validate each move and keep track of the state of the game, detecting when the game is over and producing appropriate output to the user.
